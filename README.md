# Godot Texture Atlas

!WARNING! Make sure NOT to have ANY symbols with the name "_top", symbols within directories are exempt from this rule.

Currently Unsupported Features:

- Any sort of Movie Clip effects
- The "Rotate" option within AE export settings
- And probably some other things I'm forgetting...
